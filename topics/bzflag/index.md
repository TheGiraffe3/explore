Good clean fun... sorta.
BZFlag was first made in 1992 by Chris Schoeneman.
Everyone knows that having a tank that can just fly is pretty boring. What if we told you tanks could be equipped with super powers? You'd think we're crazy, right? We were so busy thinking on how we could, that we didn't stop to think whether or not we should. Super powers for all your tanks!
